# geany-reconf

**Русскоязычное описание** [здесь](README_ru.md).

Just a helper script I use for switching between the two [Geany](http://geany.org/) configurations I use in various projects. One of them represents more or less [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) compliant stuff while another is more of my personal preference which I'm abandoning though.
